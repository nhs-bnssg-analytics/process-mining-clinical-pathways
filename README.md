Code and outputs generated for the University of Bristol and NHS BNSSG CCG EBI funded project
This work was supported by the [Elizabeth Blackwell Institute](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/blackwell/), University of Bristol and the Wellcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support Fund. This project received funding through the Elizabeth Blackwell Institute Health Data Science research strand for their Autumn 2019 funding call for projects in health data science.

## Summary of Research
This project used process mining to analyse hip replacement pathways and applied existing data mining algorithms to discover processes or clinical pathways from electronic health records.

The data used for the project was the [BNSSG System Wide Dataset](https://bnssghealthiertogether.org.uk/population-health-management/#:~:text=The%20Bristol%2C%20North%20Somerset%20and,who%20have%20not%20opted%20out) which covers primary, secondary, community and mental health care records.

This research used bupaR - an open-source, integrated suite of R-packages for the handling and analysis of business process data - along with [PM4Py](https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de/) in Python and SQL for data wranging. There are several commercial and open source tools available for process mining and analytics including ProM, Disco, Celonis and My-Invenio. More recently the open source suite of packages - bupaR - has been developed for the analysis of process data. The NHS CCGs predominately use R for modelling and data analytics and have a growing [NHS R community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) to provide support, training and resources for analysts in the NHS.  To aid reproducibility and application in the NHS, bupaR was used for these analyses.
